# Value: Adversary Emulation

Collecting cyber threat intelligence can help to support your organisationâ€™s goals to continuously protect and test security controls, detection and response processes against specific adversary tradecraft. 
Depending on the profile, some organisations that suffered previous incidents from an APT, it may be beneficial to continuously monitor evolution of threat actors. 
This is however primarily recommended to organisations with already mature security postures, as emulation is very expensive. 

Threat Intel Driven Adversary Emulation provides contextual information on specific threat actors selected, TTPs, and vulnerabilities.

- Emulate Adversaries
  - Specific attack paths based on intelligence learned from reported incidents
  - Detailed TTPs and exploited vulnerabilities
- Security Program Maturity Assurance
  - Readiness assessment against specific adversaries observed in industry peers
  - Answer objectively C level questions of can we be hacked
  - Use this as a tool to prove whether or not the security investments and budget is in line with the organisations risk tolerance
