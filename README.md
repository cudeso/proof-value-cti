# Proving the Value of Cyber Threat Intelligence

This repository documents how you can demonstrate the value of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) within an organisation. It covers approaches to prove value at tactical, operational, and strategic levels.

Whether you are part of a CSIRT, an incident responder, a threat intelligence professional, a SOC analyst, or need to communicate with management or the board, this resource provides insights to support your objectives.
